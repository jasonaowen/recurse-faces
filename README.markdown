# Recurse Faces

Learn the faces of your fellow Recursers
with the [Recurse Faces app](https://faces.recurse.com)!

This app helps users associate names and faces of
members of the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) community,
including batch mates and staff from both current and past stints.

It uses the
[Recurse Center API](https://github.com/recursecenter/wiki/wiki/Recurse-Center-API)
to cycle through a set of profile photos,
prompting users to guess the first name of the person shown in the photo.
Users can choose to see a set of hints if they are stuck,
and they can filter to see profiles
as broadly as all past and present members of the RC community
or as narrowly as only the profiles from a specific batch they attended.

## Local Set Up

The app is comprised of a Flask back-end and a React front-end.
The instructions below detail how to set up the
[front end with test data](#start-the-front-end-with-test-data),
which is the quickest way to get started
and does not require setting up the backend database and server.
To pull live data from the Recurse Center API,
see the instructions for [setting up the backend](#start-the-back-end-with-the-rc-api).

### Start the Front End with Test Data

First, install dependencies by running the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) command:

```sh
$ npm install
```

If you want to run the front end with test data,
you may set the `REACT_APP_USE_TEST_DATA` variable:

```sh
$ REACT_APP_USE_TEST_DATA=true npm run start
```

This option is the quickest way to get started,
and it is helpful when doing front end development or testing
that does not require updates to the database or calls to the RC API.
Instead of displaying photos of Recursers,
it will show photos and names of flowers:

<img src="./screenshots/test_data.png?raw=true" alt="Test Data Guess" width="400"/>

Alternatively, the `REACT_APP_USE_TEST_DATA` variable
can be added to a `.env` file
to avoid re-typing it each time the React app is started.
[Create a `.env` file](#create-a-env-file),
enable the variable `REACT_APP_USE_TEST_DATA=true`,
and then starting the React app is as simple as:
```sh
$ npm run start
```

### Start the Back End with the RC API
The Python server is a Flask app
that serves the index page and the JavaScript,
handles the OAuth login process,
and looks up names and images in the database.

Running the API locally requires populating the database
and setting up the Python environment.

#### Python Virtual Environment
You'll first need to install the Python dependencies.
First, set up a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html):

```sh
$ python3 -m venv venv
```

or

```sh
$ python3 -m virtualenv --python=python3 venv
```

Then, activate the virtual environment
and install the app's dependencies into it:

```sh
$ . venv/bin/activate
(venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To populate the database or start the Flask app,
the scripts must be run in this virtual environment (venv).
The virtual environment can be reactivated at any time with the command:
```sh
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

#### Create a .env File
The Flask app needs some configuration,
which it takes through environment variables.
For convenience, this project uses a `.env` file
to store these variables.

First, copy the `env.template` file to a new file named `.env`:
```sh
$ cp env.template .env
```

The next few sections will describe
how to set and add to this initial set of variables.

**Note**: The `.env` file should not be placed under version control
and is included in the `.gitignore` file.

#### Populate the Database

We use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as our database.
Follow the [installation instructions](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
for your platform to set up the database server.

First, choose or [create](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-createdb.html)
a database:

```sh
$ createdb --owner=$(whoami) faces
```

Depending on your platform,
you may need to run that command
as the operating system user which owns the database server:

```sh
$ sudo -u postgres createdb --owner=$(whoami) faces
```

Then, create the schema:

```sh
$ psql faces < schema.sql
```

Add your database connection URL to the `.env` file:
`DATABASE_URL=postgres:///faces/`

**Note**: the `DATABASE_URL` can be any
[libpq connection string](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING).
An alternate database URL you might try is
`postgres://localhost/faces`
to connect over TCP/IP to the database named `faces`.

There is a script
to get the data the application needs
from the Recurse Center API
and store it in the database.
To connect to the RC API,
the script needs a personal access token,
which you can create in the
[Apps page in your RC Settings](https://www.recurse.com/settings/apps).
The personal access token will only be shown once,
so copy it to a safe place
and add it to the `.env` file:
`RC_API_ACCESS_TOKEN=<personal_access_token>`

Run the script to populate the database
in your [Python Virtual Environment](#python-virtual-environment):

```sh
(venv)$ ./update-data.py
```

It should print out how many people and batches were added.

#### Start the Flask App

When running in development mode,
the app does not require authentication,
but it does need to know your Recurse Center user ID.
You can find your ID by going to the
[directory](https://www.recurse.com/directory),
looking yourself up,
and examining the number in the URL;
for example, `2092` in
`https://www.recurse.com/directory/2092-jason-owen`.

Add your RC ID to your `.env` file:
`DEFAULT_USER=<your_recurse_user_id>`

If you are working on the RC OAuth integration,
you will need to
[create an OAuth app in your RC Settings](https://www.recurse.com/settings/apps).
Then, update the `.env`
to include the generated client ID and the client secret:
`CLIENT_ID=<your_client_id>` and `CLIENT_SECRET=<your_client_secret>`.
Otherwise, those variables can remain set to the placeholder values `_`
(but must still be present and non-empty).

The `CLIENT_CALLBACK` URL variable must include
the port number the Flask instance will be running on,
which defaults to port 5000. Update this URL in your `.env` file
if using a different port.

If the `REACT_APP_USE_TEST_DATA` variable was added to your `.env`
in the steps above, set its value to `false` so that the app will
display data from the RC API.

Build the static resources for the Flask app to serve:
```sh
$ npm run build
```

Next, start the Flask API
in your [Python Virtual Environment](#python-virtual-environment):
```sh
(venv)$ flask run
```

Now, your local instance of Recurse Faces
with live data from the RC API
will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/:

<img src="./screenshots/live_rc_data.png?raw=true" alt="Live RC Data Hint" width="400"/>

However, because this instance is running
with statically generated resources from `npm build`,
local changes to the React front end
will not be reflected at this URL.

The React dev server is configured to proxy the Flask API,
so to run your local front end code
with live data from the RC API,
leave the Flask app running
and start the React front end in another terminal window:
```sh
$ npm run start
```

Now, the React front end reflecting any local code changes
will be running at http://localhost:3000/
with data from the Flask back end API
running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

## Heroku Set Up

This is app is deployed on Heroku:

```sh
$ heroku apps:create
```

To set up your Heroku app, add both the Python and Node buildpacks:

```sh
$ heroku buildpacks:add heroku/python
$ heroku buildpacks:add heroku/nodejs
```

You will also need to set several environment variables.

Three relate to the Recurse Center OAuth API. When you create your OAuth app in
your RC account settings, you will need to set the callback to be
`https://<your_url>/auth/recurse/callback`. Once you create it, you will get a
`CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`. You will also need to set a randomly chosen
password for Flask to encrypt sessions with.

```sh
$ heroku config:set \
    CLIENT_CALLBACK=https://<your_url>/auth/recurse/callback \
    CLIENT_ID=<your_client_id> \
    CLIENT_SECRET=<your_client_secret> \
    FLASK_SECRET_KEY=$(makepasswd --chars=64) \
    FLASK_ENV=production \
    RC_API_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_personal_access_token>
```

You will also need to create a database:

```sh
$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
```

and populate it:

```sh
$ heroku pg:psql < schema.sql
```

And you'll probably want logs of some sort. I'm using Papertrail:

```sh
$ heroku addons:create papertrail:choklad
```

We can schedule data updates using the
[Heroku Scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler):

```sh
$ heroku addons:create scheduler:standard
$ heroku addons:open scheduler
```

Create a new job that runs daily, and set the command to `./update-data.py`.

Then, in theory, it should be a simple `git push heroku master`!


## Troubleshooting
If you receive either of the following messages:
```sh
File "./update-data.py", line 24
headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}
                                                ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

or

```sh
/usr/bin/python: No module named flask
```

reactivate your [Python virtual environment](#python-virtual-environment),
and then try to run the previous command again.
